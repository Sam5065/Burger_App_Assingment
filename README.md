# Burger Ordering Application
I was tasked with creating a burger ordering application using C++.

Uni brief:
You are required to implement a proof-of-concept console-based burger ordering application to demonstrate to the caf√© managers. 

The burger ordering application requires the size of the burger to be selected as well as at least one topping. 
A list of available sizes and toppings is available in the table below.

The total price of the burger is the size price + the price of all toppings added.
